Memento (Externalize object internal state)
Also knows as token

By Purpose: Behavioral

Problem:
    Support undo operation


Solution
    Need to restore the original state of the ConnectionSolver without breaking encapsulation:
        - Save state ConnectionSolver
        - Store memento state for alter use
        - Restore ConnectionSolver state on undo

Intent:
    Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that
    the object can be restored to this state later

When:
    Save a snapshot of an object state
    direct interface to object state would violate encapsulation

Structure:
    State stored in the Memento pattern
    Specific Memento definition
    Originator creates memento
    Memento shields from clients other than originator
    Originator uses memento to restore state
    Caretaker: safe keep the memento

Collaboration:
    Caretaker creates memento
    Originator set new memento and sets state
    Caretaker sets memento again to originator
    Originator requests state of memento

Benefits:
    Preserve encapsulation
    Simplifies originator

Drawbacks:
    Object creation might be expensive
    Language must facilitate that only the originator can access the memento's state
    Extra management for caretaking the mementos

Conclusion: Memento pattern is great for:
    Access state but preserve encpasulation
    Save snapshot of object date to use later

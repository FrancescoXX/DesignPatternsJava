Chain Of Responsibility (Decouple sender and receiver)

Intent
    Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a change o handle the request.
    Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it

When
    Multiple objects need to handle a request
    isn't clear upfront who will handle it
    who can handle the request should be dynamic

Structure
    Interface for handling requests, keep successors list
    Different handlers implementations
    Client invokes the first handler

Benefits
    Loose coupling between requester and receiver
    Objects can spread responsibility in handling requests

Drawbacks:
    No guarantee the request will be handled

Conclusion
    CoR is great:
    Handle requests dynamically
    Enhanced loose coupling between sender and receiver

Singleton Pattern

By Purpose: Creational
By Scope: Object

Examples:
    - One FileSystem, Window Manager

Issues:
    - Multiple classes require the same object instance
    - There can only be one object fir the entire application
    - It must be guaranteed that there is only one object

Solution:
    - Let class menage its one instance

Intent:
    - Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it

When:
    - Only one instance of class required
    - Must be one access point
    - Need to menage object instances (eg. db pool)

Builder Pattern

By Purpose: Creational
By Scope: Object

Examples:


Issues:
    - Search screen results in three objects (eg 3 databases, one for each db)
    - Need to construct the three objects over and over again (same set of code)

Future proof:
    - Ideally we would like to support a fourth database without changing too much code

Intent:
    - Separate the constructor of a complex object from its representation so that
      the same construction process can create different representations

When:
    - Separate constructor with internal representation
    - One process -> multiple object representation
    - Object construction <> object assembling

Benefits:
    - Uniform production creation with an interface
    - Abstract building process
    - Loose coupling
        - Construction
        - Representation
    - Finer control on the build process -> Allow multiple steps

Conclusion:
Builder pattern is great for:
    - One build process for multiple similar objects
    - Advance control over the build process

Bridge (Decouple abstraction from implementation)
Also known as: Handle, Body

By Purpose: Structural

Examples:

Issues:
    Create a multiplatform window toolkit

Intent:
    Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary indipendently

When:
    Avoid binding between interface and implementation
    Possible subclasses for abstraction and implementation
    Must be possible to change implementation at runtime without affecting clients

Structure:
    Define abstraction interface
    Maintain reference to implementer
    Implementor define operation implementation methods
    Multiple subclassing

Benefits:
    Decouple interface and implementation
    improve extensibility
    hide implementation details

Conclusion:
    Bridge pattern is great to :
        decouple interface from implementation
        reduce number of subclasses
